# JsonFieldExplorer (jfe)

## Description

JsonFieldExplorer (jfe) is a command-line tool that simplifies the exploration of JSON data structures. It analyzes JSON files and lists all possible field paths, aiding in understanding and navigating complex JSON objects. This tool is especially useful for developers and data analysts working with large and nested JSON files.

# Installation

To install JsonFieldExplorer, use npm:

```bash
npm install -g jsonfieldexplorer
```

This will install jfe globally on your system, allowing you to use it from any directory.

Requires minimum of node 18.x.

# Usage

To use jfe, simply pass the path of your JSON file as an argument:

```bash
jfe path/to/yourfile.json
```

You can also pipe in JSON.

```bash
$ echo '{"a": [{"b": true}]}' | jfe
.a: array
.a[]: object
.a[].b: boolean
```

# Examples

Given a JSON file like this:

```json
{
  "organization": {
    "name": "OpenAI",
    "location": "San Francisco",
    "departments": [
      {
        "name": "Research",
        "employees": 10,
        "isRemote": true
      },
      {
        "name": "Engineering",
        "employees": "80",
        "budget": null,
        "manager": {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "title": "Engineering Manager"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Running jfe on this file would produce output similar to the following:

```css
.organization: object
.organization.name: string
.organization.location: string
.organization.departments: array (size: 2)
.organization.departments[]: object
.organization.departments[].name: string
.organization.departments[].employees: number | string
.organization.departments[].isRemote: boolean
.organization.departments[].budget: null
.organization.departments[].manager: object
.organization.departments[].manager.name: string
.organization.departments[].manager.title: string
```

This output indicates that the JSON file contains fields for the organization's name and location, as well as an array of departments, each with its own name and number of employees.

# Roadmap

For future roadmap, features that could be implemented are;

- Show types in order of usage.
- Show enum if variation is small in type.
- Provide a "stat" command to show statistics about the values. Like most common strings (if enum), or min/max/average for numbers.

If you want to contribute with any of these, feel free to send a PR!
